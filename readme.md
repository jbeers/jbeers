## Hello, my name is Jacob!

I've been working professionaly as a software developer since 2015 and currently work for Ortus Solutions.

Check out [BoxLang](https://boxlang.com) the new JVM language we are working on! 

I'm responsible for the official [BoxLang VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=ortus-solutions.vscode-boxlang). You can find it in the marketplace. 

I consider myself a full-stack developer.
