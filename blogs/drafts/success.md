How do you go about defining success?

* Success needs to be in line with your values
* It must be concrete, measurable, and achievable
* It should have personal and corporate benefit
* It should profit more than the cost. Especially if someone else is paying for it
* It should be open to new information - we aren't perfect, only God is

## Success Needs to be in Line With Your Values

If it you are successful but it doesn't line up with your values then it won't feel right when you get there. You may achieve
your goal but deep down you will feel like a failure.

## It Must be Concrete, Measurable, and Achievable

It needs to be concrete so that you can experience it. It needs to be measurable so you can tell if you are headed in the right
direction. And it needs to be achievable so that you are not wasting your time.

I'm concerned that these words will be heard negatively. They should not be. These are not meant to be dogmatic or robotic. They
are meant to be the necessary structure to help you flourish.

Almost anytime an idea pops into our head we think it is fantastic. It is so easy to become enamored with our own imagination.
This can be a trap though. Our imaginations are wonderful tools but they rarely line up with reality. I can imagine a box but if
I don't sit down and define its width, height, and length - is it a real box? Even if I define those, I need to decided what material it is.
Your idea might be creative and exciting but if you can't make it concrete you can't be successful in it.

The purpose of having a measurable definition of success is not to bury your efforts under endless testing. Measurements are meant to help
you understand if you are traveling towards your stated goal. If you want to learn to draw portraits it may help for you to draw the same portrait every week in addition to your regular practice. Keep the conditions the same so that you can compare your drawings and see that
areas of improvement and reveal areas where you consistently struggle.

Finally, your goal must also be achievable. This is a difficult one. How can you know if your goal is achievable if you have never done it before?
I don't mean to say that you shouldn't try to push your boundaries. You should. I just mean that you should couch your goals within a "reasonable"
perspective on your current state. It is not easy to know what is and is not achievable. You will fail repeatedly to set "achievable" goals for
yourself. Our eyes are always too big for our stomachs. But with failure comes the opportunity to learn and hone your ability to set successful goals. It also helps to have other, more experienced than yourself around you to guide and cousel you.

## The Benefit Should be Personal and Corporate

We don't live in a vaccuum. All of our choices affect those around us. Whatever you work for will cost those around you in some way,
even if it is just that they no longer have access to your resources. If you don't plan for them to benefit in some way they will feel 
strained by your efforts and you will lose valuable support.

Conversely your goals cannot be solely focused on others. You have legitimate needs and having your needs met can also be of benefit to
those around you. If your needs never get met you will naturally become resentful towards others, even if you are the one depriving
yourself. That doesn't help anyone.

This doesn't mean that all payoffs have to be equal. It is okay for the personal benefit to be greater than the corporate benefit, or vice-versa. The important thing is to understand the ways that this success can affect both yourself and your community and to incorporate those factors into
your deciscion making.

## It Should Profit More Than it Costs

This should go without saying but sometimes it is a hard lesson to learn. It is very easy to get caught up in the end goal that you forget
the things you gave up to get there. Often we hear the phrase "the ends justify the means". This is not always true. Usually this is said by
people who are talking about achieving their own ends at the cost of someone elses' means. All of our efforts have a cost, our energy, time,
and resources are precious commodities. Once they are spent they are often impossible to recover. It is therefore of the utmost importance that
we steward what we are given well and make sure that we get a return on our investment.

It is especially important to consider the profit when someone else is paying the cost. When we are handling the profits but someone else
pays the cost it is very easy to become entitled. Entitlement is a good way to kill your hopes of success or potentially worse, to keep
you from understanding or benefitting from the success you have. Entitlement can even turn your success against you and make it a pit.

## Your Definition of Success Should be Open

Sometimes when we look to the future and dream about what might be everything looks golden. Often we don't even know what we are looking at or where to go. We rarely have the clarity to understand where we want to be, how to get there, and what it will cost. That is okay. Our definition
of success should always be open to correction and development. You may do everything you can to plan your steps but after you have made it halfway down the path you realize it is much too costly. Maybe you make it all the way across the finish line and are surprised by your lack of
fulfillment, you see now that even though you completed your goal it never really lined up with your values.

God has made us limited creatures in many many ways. We know almost nothing about the future, we know only some about the present, and the past
is often confusing as well. He did not make us to be all powerful or all knowing and does not expect that from us. Over and over God tells us that He desires humility in our hearts. He wants us to love Him and trust Him. To have faith that He is good and rewards those that earneslty seek Him. Preach those words to yourself and submit yourself to His Holy Spirit. It is hard and scary but choose not to lean on your own understand, but acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and He will make your paths straight.
