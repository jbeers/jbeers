I've been struggling recently to start a writing habbit. I hate writing. Recently though, I've begun to appreciate how powerful of a communication tool it is. I think my disdain arose in middle school as the constant pressure to fill word counts led me to write ridiculous sentences filled with fluff.

Working as a software developer has caused a huge shift in the way I view writing. For one, I've begun to see the value in written communication. It may even be more valuable that raw programming ability. Communicating clearly with a teammate enables you both to work together and multiplies your efforts. Second, I've noticed that many of the skills I use to develop and refactor code are congruent with good writing. This is helpful for me because it means I already understand much of what goes into producing a good piece of writing. Perhaps more importantly, it helps me see that if good writing and good coding are similar and I enjoy writing code, then just maybe I can find something to enjoy about writing.

# Some Advice

Recently, on Twitter, I came across a tweet that gave some really great writing advice.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Write to be a good writer, not primarily to be a published one.<br><br>Emphasize being a good and prolific thinker (careful, critical, creative, curious) rather than just a prolific writer.<br><br>Write to say true things well, full stop. <a href="https://t.co/uzrxwTFhM4">https://t.co/uzrxwTFhM4</a></p>&mdash; Barnabas Piper (@BarnabasPiper) <a href="https://twitter.com/BarnabasPiper/status/1293578105303556097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

This stuck out to me because I've found it to be true when programming as well. I became a much better programmer when I stopped trying to be "clever" and started to just fix the problems that were in front of me as best I could.

# How To Do Your Best

One important question that I think we often forget to ask ourselves is "How do I do my best as often as I can?". I've found a process that has been working for me lately.

* Understand the problem
* Come up with multiple solutions
* Select whatever seems best
* Implement it as quickly as I can
* Test/Iterate
* Cleanup/make obvious improvements
* Ship it

I think I'm going to try and apply this to writing as well. Instead of being so focused on trying to find "the article I should write" I'm just going to select something relevant and then do my best to communicate it through writing. I think this will be a good start but I'm not sure that it covers everything. What if I write about something that seems relevant but isn't actually? Well, I'm sure that sometimes that will happen but I think that is what the second part of the tweet addresses.

>Emphasize being a good and prolific thinker (careful, critical, creative, curious) rather than just a prolific writer.<br><br>Write to say true things well, full stop.

This is great advice. Spend more time being a good thinker who pursues truth and let that drive the things that you want to write about. Personally I think that I will start using a little journal to write down ideas and gather notes in a common location for me to workthrough, review, and write from.
