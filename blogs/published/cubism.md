Coming up with small doodles for to accompany my blog posts has gotten kind of tedious. I like having images but the process of creating an image to go along with a blog post has kept me from achieving my goal for this site. It isn't that the small doodles are hard to draw there are just many steps involved. Sketch, cleanup, transfer to computer, digitize, put on site.

I was on someone elses blog earlier this week, unfortunately I can't remember who, and their portrait was simply a photo that had been posterized. It wasn't especially artistic but it showed their face and had a nice creativity to it. Silly as it sounds I realized that I really didn't need to have a nice custom doodle with every blog post. It's a nice idea, and I hope to do more doodles in the future but I really need to come up with a better process.

Until I find that better process, I'd like to have the option of generating a nice image from a random photo. Preferably I'd like it to be more abstract but still aesthetically pleasing. That way, I don't have to pick a relevant image or worry about copyright. I can just grab something off my phone or the internet and run it through the process to make someting generic. To achieve this I knew I needed an image editor.

# Enter the GIMP

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is an open source/free image editing program. I'm currently running linux as my operating system. I like it but it can't run photshop natively. GIMP, however, does run on linux!

I opened up GIMP and grabbed a random photo I had stored on my computer. As soon as it loaded I opened up the filter dialog and began clicking on random options. I was not very pleased with the results. In an attempt to emulate the photo I saw on the person's blog I tried to use the posterize filter. I very rarely get good results from posterizing though and it mostly came out fuzzy looking. I continued clicking around but wasn't able to find anything like, until I came across the cubism filter.

I played around with the settings a bit and eventually came up with something I thought was nice.

I think the process could still be simplified. I tried to look into making a script to do this for me automatically but I didn't like my
options. It would be fun to look into writing a small program to perform this filter on any given image. For now though its nice to have this as an option.
