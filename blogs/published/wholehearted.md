I have been thinking a lot lately about the term "wholehearted", especially as it pertains to our relationship with God. In
the past I have tended to view being "wholehearted" as a level of devotion or indicator of strength. "I am whole-heartedly loving
God if I..." and then that sentence can be comepleted any number of ways: read a certain of the Bible each day, study some book of the Bible
very deeply, devote myself to prayer for an hour a day, etc... Recently though my perspective on this word has been changing. I think I'm beginningt to realize that it is much more complex than I thought. I'm not sure that it is something that can be expressed in a simple action.

# Jeremiah 29:11-13

Today, I opened an archeologica bible that was given to me by my grandparents. In the dedication my Mawgee (That's what I called my grandma) had written the reference "Jeremiah 29:11-13". Jeremiah 29:11 is a very famous verse, one I'm sure you've heard. "For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper and not to destroy..." Yeah, that's the one. I scoffed a bit at what is often critiqued as an over-used encouragement. I noticed though that for my Mawgee to add verses 12 and 13 was somewhat unusual. I couldn't remember exactly what those referred to - so I looked it up.

> For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
> Jeremiah 29:11-13 NIV

The end of verse 13, _when you seek Me with all your heart_, really stuck out to me. I tend to emphase the cost of "all your heart" over the action of seeking Him. I don't mean that I don't think seeking Him is important. I mean that I often give so much priority to being passionate
or to "paying the cost" that I forget to think about what I'm actually buying. Am I actually passionate about the Lord or am I just trying to get
across some finish line? It's hard to tell, but honestly I rarely even ask the question.

# What Does it Mean?

I think "wholehearted" means exactly how it reads. Seeking God with your whole heart doesn't just mean seeking Him with the parts that involve paying costs. It means taking the time to figure out which parts you have neglected, held back, or overlooked. It means taking the time to understand whoe He is before you commit - or rather to commit to Him, get to know Him better and commit again. I've recently been trying to buy a house and have had to sign many many contracts. I skimmed them all at first but I felt bad about it. After that I resolved to read the contracts in full so I would really know what I was getting into. Not to be difficult, we have great realaters that we trust, but so that I can be be fully invested. This, I think, is an accurate picture of what it means to be wholehearted. Do you want to follow the Lord? Great! Thats good! Read the contract.
