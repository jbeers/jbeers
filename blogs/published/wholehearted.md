What does it mean to be wholehearted? What does it mean in our relationship with God? Until recently, I have always measured "wholeheartedness" by intensity of devotion. Until recently it was all about my emotional passion. Don't get me wrong passion is important, but more and more I think it is oversold. I think a better way to measure our wholeheartedness is by examining the thoroughness of our commitment. Think sous vide instead of flash frying. 

# Jeremiah 29:11-13

Today, I opened an archeological bible that was given to me by my grandparents. My Mawgee (That's what I called my grandma) had written the dedication, and added the reference "Jeremiah 29:11-13". Jeremiah 29:11 is a very famous verse, one that, I'm sure you've heard before, "For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper and not to destroy..." I admit that I scoffed a bit when I saw the reference. My self-righteousness flared up for a moment to judge what is often critiqued as an over-used out-of-context encouragement. Something pulled me back and urged me to look at the reference again. It was always in your best interest to keep your wits about you when dealing with Mawgee. She had a wonderful way of putting you just slightly off balance before kicking your legs out from underneath you. I checked the reference again and this time I noticed the inclusion of verses 12 and 13. I couldn't remember exactly what those referred to - so I looked it up.

> For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
> Jeremiah 29:11-13 NIV

The end of verse 13, _when you seek Me with all your heart_, really stuck out to me. This to me, confirms what I wrote earlier. Wholeheartedness is about thoroughness not intensity. The verse doesn't say to love God by sacrificing one chunk of your heart on a flaming altar, it says to seek Him with all of it. "Seeking" is a sustained action. It's a commitment. It cannot be fueled by passion alone. We are limited beings. What happens when the passion runs out? Seeking God with all of your heart is not something you can do in a moment. As humans, we lack bot the intensity it requires and the commitment He requires of us.

# Being Wholehearted

I was praying and meditating about this idea and I think the Lord gave me a image that helps to explain what is going on here. As "luck" would have it I happen to be buying a house right now. It turns out purchasing a house is a good metaphor for being wholehearted. When you are looking at pictures of a house listing its very easy to get caught up in the beauty of the house. Fantasies of the life that could be cloud your vision and convince you that useless beuracracy is the only thing between you and your forever home. Sometimes though, you see the house in person and your fantasies are shattered, you realize some fault you didn't see before and your passion is gone. Your fantasies were passionate to be sure, but they lacked your whole heart. It was really only the dream that kept you there not the house itself.

There is, however, another process to buying a house. You take time and consider what you want. You look at multiple houses that have different combinations of the features you want. Some fit better than others but you evaluate them on your experience of seeing them in person. If you find one you like, you make an offer and wait to hear back. You still haven't purchased the house though. Now you need to get an inspection. Sure, the front door is beautiful, but what does the foundation look like? It's got a pool! Awesome! Does it have enough bedrooms for your family to grow? What about the plumbing? Is it solid? Do the windows open or are they all painted shut? The roof is in good shape but could there have been a leak at one point? You pay your own money to inspect someone elses house because you want it to become yours and you need to know what you are getting into. Its not instant, its not passionate, but it is searching driven by what you want the future to be like. Eventually you are given a very long contract that you and your agent go over and sign paragraph by paragraph. Often we skim the details but in a perfect world we read the agreement and understand what we are getting into. This is what it means to seek. This is what it means to be wholehearted.

# Conclusion

I'm not very far in the process of giving my whole heart to God, but I'm thankful to have started the journey. I don't understand all of the details yet, but that is okay. He doesn't call us to omnipotence, He calls us to seeking. My passion may fall short at times, but each day my heart will grow deeper and depper in love with Him. My heart will be thoroughly His. And I think that is what He wants.
