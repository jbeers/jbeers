I think the last time I launched a personal website was nearly 10 years ago. I was in college and was hoping to begin a small freelance graphic design business on the side. I didn't end up doing any freelance graphic design but I did complete the website. It was the first full website I ever made and built it using Dreamweaver. I didn't end up keeping it up for very long but it felt like an accomplishment.

Fast forward to 2020 and I have a new website! This time I'm launching the website with several years of experience as a web developer under my belt. Even still it's been a fun project and I've been able to learn quite a bit. I won't go into too much detail but I'd like to outline a few of the things that stuck out to me while developing this site.

# The Technology

I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to develop the site. I've used Gatsby a grand total of 3 times now. Twice for personal projects and once professionally. To be honest, I'm thoroughly ipressed with it. I wasn't sold on the JAMstack idea but I'm growing more and more optimistic. I even have another Gatsby project lined up.

My site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I'm just starting out with their service but am liking everything I've seen so far. Currently I'm updating my by manually authoring the pages but I want to give NetlifyCMS a try sooner rather than later.

# The Approach

When starting a new project I often am to eager to jump directly into the coding. This time, I was very diligent in sticking to the planning phase. I forced myself to spend several hours defining why I was building the website, exploring the requirements, designing every page, and revising my work before I wrote a single line of code. It wasn't easy for me (because of my personality) but it was definitely the right way to do a project like this. Taking the time to organize my thoughts and develop them in a low cost way (sketches, outlines, etc...) gave me a clear direction of what I was building and helped me keep from getting off track and wasting time.

# The Execution

In my original design I wanted to use squiggly lines as a design accent throughout the site. When I began working on the squiggles it was a much more difficult feature than I expected. After working on it for nearly two hours I scrapped the idea. I was frustrated that I wasted so much time on something so small. Details are important and they bring a lot of life to a project but it is important to know when they aren't worth it. I still think the squiggly line is a good addition to the site and will be working on working it into the site soon, but it wasn't something that should prevent the whole site from launching.

Recognizing that the squiggle was cool but twould be better as a phase 2 feature was a great learning experience for me. I often get caught up in the granduer of my own ideas (sad) and the amount of work required to bring a "perfect" idea out of nothing often crushes my attempts. Taking an iterative approach and pacing myself produced better work in a shorter time span. Win/win.

# The Aftermath

Now that the site is launched I'm going to take some time to outline some high reward low cost improvements I can make and begin to knock those out. This site is not anywhere close to the most important thing in my life but spending 5-10 hours on it over the next 6 months could really improve it and make it something I'm more proud of.
